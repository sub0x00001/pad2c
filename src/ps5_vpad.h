/* Each connected Bluetooth pad becomes a virtual DualSense on the console,
 * bound to the main user (the one in the foreground, who ran the jailbreak).
 *
 * The PS5 path:
 *
 *   0. The process gets system-service credentials (checked, read back).
 *   1. libSceMbus is loaded before any scePad call (libScePad imports it).
 *   2. scePadVirtualDeviceAddDevice({32, user 1, ...}, DualSense) creates an
 *      MBus device. Its return value is a status, not a handle.
 *   3. The kernel log announces the device:
 *        SCE_MBUS_EVENT_DEVICE_ADDED [DeviceId:0x...][type:1][subType:22]...
 *   4. sceMbusBindDeviceWithUserId(DeviceId, user) gives it to the user.
 *   5. scePadVirtualDeviceInsertData(DeviceId & 0xffffffff, &ScePadData)
 *      feeds it.
 *
 * Only a device identified without doubt is ever bound, fed or deleted:
 * one DEVICE_ADDED line, and only one, between our AddDevice and a few
 * seconds later. Anything else is logged and left alone.
